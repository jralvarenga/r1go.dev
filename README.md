# Personal Website

This is my personal website built with **Astro**.

The goal of this project is to experiment with:
- SEO and web search behavior
- Performance and static-first rendering
- Content structure and discoverability

The site is intentionally minimal and serves as a playground for testing ideas around visibility, speed, and user experience.

## Tech Stack
- Astro

## Status
Actively evolving and used for experimentation.
