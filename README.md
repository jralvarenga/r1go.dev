# Personal Website

This is my personal website built with **Astro**.

The goal of this project is to experiment with:

- SEO and web search behavior
- Performance and static-first rendering
- Content structure and discoverability

The site is intentionally minimal and serves as a playground for testing ideas around visibility, speed, and user experience.

I took inspiration from **Lee Robinson’s personal website**, particularly in its simplicity and content-first approach.

## Tech Stack

- Astro

## Status

Actively evolving and used for experimentation.
